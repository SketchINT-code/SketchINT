We implement TowerSketch on a Virtex-7 family of Xilinx FPGA (xc7vx690tffg1761-2).
The capacity of the on-chip RAMs (Block RAM) is 30.6Mb.
The resource usage information is as follows: 
1) We use 45.5 Block RAM Tile, 3.1% of the total on-chip Block RAM. 
2) We use 686 LUTs, less than %1 of the 433200 total available. 
The clock frequency of our implemented FPGA is 365 MHz, meaning processing speed of 365 Mpps.
